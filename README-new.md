wp-cli/wp-cli-bundle
=================

Combines the most common commands into the standard, installable version of WP-CLI.

Generally, bundled commands either relate directly to a WordPress API or offer some common developer convenience. New commands are included in the WP-CLI bundle when the [project governance](https://make.wordpress.org/cli/handbook/contributions/governance/) decides they should be. There isn't much of a formal process to it, so feel free to ask if you ever have a question.

The handbook documents the [various ways you can install the bundle](https://make.wordpress.org/cli/handbook/guides/installing/). The Phar is [built on every merge](https://github.com/wp-cli/wp-cli-bundle/blob/main/.github/workflows/deployment.yml) and pushed to [wp-cli/builds](https://github.com/wp-cli/builds) repository. A stable version is [tagged a few times each year](https://make.wordpress.org/cli/handbook/contributions/release-checklist/).
